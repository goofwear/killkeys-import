When KillKeys is enabled, keys specified here will be disabled.
The first line specify which keys will be disabled when not in fullscreen.
The second line specify which keys will be disabled when in fullscreen.
Anything after the second line is ignored.

By default, both windows keys and the menu key are disabled when in fullscreen.

Even though the page specify codes for the mouse buttons, KillKeys can't disable them since it only uses a keyboard hook.
After editing this file, be sure to disable and then enable KillKeys to refresh the config.

Be careful, a malformed config.txt may crash KillKeys or make it go into an infinite loop, consuming 100% cpu.
If you add more than 190 keys, KillKeys might crash when you bring up the About box. This will be fixed in a later release.
