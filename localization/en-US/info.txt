KillKeys
Made by Stefan Sundin

When enabled, keys specified in KillKeys.ini will be disabled.
By default, both windows keys and the menu key are disabled when in fullscreen.

KillKeys will automatically check for updates.
You can disable this in KillKeys.ini.

You can use -hide as a parameter to hide the tray icon.
